# **India Air Pollution DSA**

A **C++ Data Structures and Algorithms based command-line project** that analyzes
city-wise AQI (Air Quality Index) data across India. The system ranks polluted
cities, prioritizes pollution sources, and suggests AQI-based mitigation
solutions using pure DSA logic.

---

## **Features**

- Display AQI data for each city with AQI category
- Sort and list most polluted cities (highest to lowest AQI)
- Identify priority pollution sources using a priority queue (max heap)
- Suggest practical solutions based on AQI severity
- Menu-driven console interface

---

## **Data Structures & Algorithms Used**

- Arrays / Vectors  
- Structures  
- Sorting Algorithms  
- Priority Queue (Max Heap)  
- Greedy Logic  
- Conditional Decision Logic  

---

## **Project Files**

- `air_pollution_dsa.cpp` — main source code  
- `README.md` — project documentation  
- `.gitignore` — ignores build and temporary files  

---

## **Build & Run (Windows)**

```powershell
g++ air_pollution_dsa.cpp -o air.exe
.\air.exe
